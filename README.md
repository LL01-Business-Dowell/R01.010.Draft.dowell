### Dowell Hackathon Journey

Feeling really excited as the team for our hackathon is all ready and set
More and more participants are registering even as this is written.
10 or more different teams are set up consisting of  participants and with one mentor for each team.
The coming days will see discussions among team members with mentors giving clarifications to the participants queries.
Each and every participant gets an opportunity to learn more about the hackathon from our mentors and by the time the hackathon is kicked off, participants will be placed perfectly to put their ideas on canvas.
